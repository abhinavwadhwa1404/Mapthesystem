# **Map the System: Breaking Systemic Barriers for International Medical Graduates in Canada**

**Map the System** is a systems-thinking project aimed at addressing the chronic underemployment of International Medical Graduates (IMGs) in Canada. Despite widespread physician shortages, thousands of skilled IMGs face barriers in licensing, employment, and recognition. This project explored the root causes and proposed actionable solutions to create a more inclusive healthcare system.

## **Key Focus Areas**
- **Structural Barriers:** Mapped licensing and residency bottlenecks using the **Iceberg Model** and **Causal Loop Diagrams**, identifying inefficiencies in the current system.
- **Cultural & Credential Bias:** Analysed how undervaluation of international medical credentials and cultural perceptions hinder IMG employment.
- **Policy Gaps:** Highlighted misalignment between healthcare demands and current residency allocation policies.

---

## **Tools & Methodology**
- **Journey Mapping:** Illustrated the IMG experience to identify critical pain points.
- **Stakeholder Analysis:** Evaluated the roles of medical councils, provincial governments, and immigration authorities.
- **Causal Loop Analysis:** Exposed feedback loops that perpetuate underemployment.

---

## **Proposed Solutions**
- **Credential Recognition Reform:** Introduce faster and transparent evaluation systems.
- **Bridging Programs:** Provide clinical exposure and mentorship opportunities to align IMGs with Canadian medical standards.
- **Policy Advocacy:** Encourage collaboration between **Health Canada** and immigration agencies to align workforce strategies.
- **Public Awareness Campaigns:** Promote trust in IMGs through data-backed initiatives.

## **Impact**
This project provided policymakers, healthcare institutions, and advocacy groups with actionable insights. By combining **systems thinking** with data-driven analysis, we demonstrated how integrating IMGs can:
- Reduce healthcare wait times.
- Address physician shortages.
- Diversify and strengthen Canadaâ€™s medical workforce.
